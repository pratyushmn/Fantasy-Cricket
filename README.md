# Fantasy-Cricket
A Fantasy Cricket Game using Python, PyQT, and SQLite3 Databases

**Next Steps:**
Create website scraper to automatically add players, update player stats, and change player costs in the database
Also, allow functionality for actual cricket match stats to be uploaded, by providing a link to the scorecard of an upcoming match. The user should then be able to create a fantasy team from the squads of both teams playing in the match, and then evaluate his/her team's performance once the match has completed.
